Today we'll create a playbook to automate a initial server setup on Ubuntu

Prerequisites: Ansible installed on a control node, one or more managed nodes set up in your inventory.

Tasks we'll automate:
  1. create user and add it to sudo group
  2. copy local public key to remote user's authorized_keys
  3. enable UFW firewall (allow SSH only)
